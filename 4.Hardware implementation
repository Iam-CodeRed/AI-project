The sentiment analysis code can be integrated into an Internet of Things (IoT) device that processes text input and provides
real-time feedback on sentiment. The device can be used for customer feedback analysis, mood tracking, or sentiment-based
notifications.

Hardware Components
Microcontroller or Microcomputer – A Raspberry Pi or Arduino with a Wi-Fi module to run the sentiment analysis code.

LCD or LED Display – To show the sentiment classification result.

Input Interface – A keypad, touchscreen, or microphone for text or speech input.

Indicator LEDs – Green, red, and yellow LEDs to visually represent positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Working Mechanism
The user inputs text through a keypad or microphone.

The microcontroller processes the input using the sentiment analysis algorithm from the provided Python code.

The sentiment classification result is displayed on an LCD screen or represented through colored LED indicators.

The system can store data for further analysis or send notifications based on the sentiment detected.

Potential Applications
Customer feedback terminals in retail stores and service centers.

Mood tracking devices for personal or healthcare use.

Smart social media monitors that analyze and filter online interactions.

This implementation can be adapted for various domains, providing real-time sentiment insights in an interactive and 
efficient manner.
