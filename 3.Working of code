Working of the Code
User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a sentence.

Sentiment Analysis:

The input text is processed using the TextBlob library.

TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity calculates the polarity score of the sentence, ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).

Polarity Interpretation:

If polarity is greater than 0, the sentiment is Positive.

If polarity is less than 0, the sentiment is Negative.

If polarity is exactly 0, the sentiment is Neutral.

Result Display: The program prints the sentiment classification based on the polarity score.
